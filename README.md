Hi, I am <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arka_karmoker/">Arka Karmoker</a>. Currently, I am studying B.Sc in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) at <a href="http://www.northsouth.edu/">North South University</a>. I live in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am interested in web application development. I am currently learning MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). I am familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap, git, MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, C, C++, Java etc. I have some project related to these technologies. Some projects are already uploaded, some will be uploaded in future.
